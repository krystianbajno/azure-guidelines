    A DMARC record published at the second-level domain will protect all subdomains.

    In other words, a DMARC record published for `example.com` will protect both

    `a.example.com` and `b.example.com`, but a separate record would need to be

    published for `c.example.gov`.


    To test your DMARC configuration, consider using one of many publicly available

    web-based tools. Additionally, DMARC records can be requested using the

    PowerShell tool `Resolve-DnsName`. For example:


    ```

    Resolve-DnsName _dmarc.example.com txt

    ```


    If DMARC is configured, a response resembling `v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100; rua=mailto:reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov,
    mailto:reports@example.com; ruf=mailto:reports@example.com`

    will be returned, though by necessity, the contents of the record will vary

    by agency. In this example, the policy indicates all emails failing the

    SPF/DKIM checks are to be rejected and aggregate reports sent to

    reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov and reports@example.com. Failure reports will be

    affect all or some environments or exclude certain environments. The

    more restrictive policy will be enforced when there is a conflict.

    Connectors can be separated by creating a DLP policy assigning them

    to one of three groups: Business, Non-Business, and Blocked. Connectors

    in different groups cannot be used in the same Power App. Connectors in

    the Blocked group cannot be used at all. (Note: Some M365 connectors

    cannot be blocked, such as Teams and SharePoint connectors).

    and write permissions to the data source/service. Connectors that cannot

    be blocked cannot be configured. Agencies should evaluate the

    connectors and configure them to fit agency needs and security

    requirements. The agency should then create a DLP policy to only allow

    Power Platform tenant isolation is different from Microsoft Entra ID wide tenant

    restriction. It does not impact Microsoft Entra-based access outside of Power

    Platform. Power Platform tenant isolation only works for connectors

    using Microsoft Entra-based authentication, such as Office 365 Outlook or

    SharePoint. The default configuration in Power Platform has tenant

    isolation set to **Off**, allowing for cross-tenant connections to

    be established. A user from tenant A using a Power App with a connector

    can seamlessly establish a connection to tenant B if using appropriate

    Microsoft Entra ID credentials.

    If admins want to allow only a select set of tenants to establish

    connections to or from their tenant, they can turn on tenant isolation.

    Once tenant isolation is turned on, inbound (connections to the tenant

    from external tenants) and outbound (connections from the tenant to

    external tenants) cross-tenant connections are blocked by Power Platform

    even if the user presents valid credentials to the Microsoft Entra-secured data

    for detail.\nSeveral best practices and approaches are available to protect sensitive\n\
    data in Power BI:\n- Leverage sensitivity labels via Microsoft Purview Information\
    \ Protection.\n- Power BI allows service users to bring their own key to protect\

    \ and\nleverage Direct Query or Live Connect with an on-premises data gateway\n\
    to minimize data exposure to the cloud service.\n- Implement row-level security\
    \ in Power BI datasets.\n**Implementation Steps**\n**Apply sensitivity labels\
    \ from data sources to their data in Power BI**\nWhen this setting is enabled,\
    \ Power BI datasets that connect to\nsensitivity-labeled data in supported data\
    \ sources can inherit those\nlabels, so the data remains classified and secure\
    \ when brought into\nPower BI. For details about sensitivity label inheritance\
    \ from data\nsources, see below:\n***To enable sensitivity label inheritance from\
    \ data sources:***\n1.  Navigate to the Power BI tenant settings.\n2. Select **Information\
    \ protection** -\\> **Apply sensitivity labels\nfrom data sources to their data\
    \ in Power BI (preview).**\n3. Enable **Restrict content with protected labels\
    \ from being shared\nvia link with everyone in your agency**.\nWhen this setting\
    \ is enabled, users can't generate a sharing link for\npeople in the agency for\
    \ content with protection settings in the\nsensitivity label.\nSensitivity labels\
    \ with protection settings include encryption or\ncontent markings. For example,\
    \ the agency may have a \"Highly\nConfidential\" label that includes encryption\
    \ and applies a \"Highly\nConfidential\" watermark to content with this label.\
    \ When this\ntenant setting is enabled and a report has a sensitivity label with\n\

    # Appendix B: Source Code and Credential Security Considerations\nExposing secrets\
    \ via collaboration spaces is a security concern when\nusing Power BI.\nFor Power\
    \ BI embedded applications, it is recommended to implement a\nsource code scanning\
    \ solution to identify credentials within the code of\nany app housing embedded\
    \ Power BI report(s). A source code scanner can\nalso encourage moving discovered\
    \ credentials to more secure locations,\nsuch as Azure key vault.\nStore encryption\
    \ keys or service principal credentials used for\nencrypting or accessing Power\
    \ BI in a Key Vault, assign proper access\npolicies to the vault, and regularly\
    \ review access permissions.\nFor regulatory or other compliance reasons, some\
    \ agencies may need to\nuse BYOK, which is supported by Power BI. By default,\n\
    Power BI uses Microsoft-managed keys to encrypt the data. In Power BI\nPremium,\
    \ users can use their own keys for data at-rest imported\ninto a dataset. See\
    \ [Data source and storage\nconsiderations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/service-encryption-byok#data-source-and-storage-considerations)\n\
    for more information.\n- For Power BI embedded applications, a best practice is\
    \ to implement a\nsource code scanning solution to identify credentials within\
    \ the code\nof the app housing the embedded Power BI report(s).\n- If required\
    \ under specific regulations, agencies need a strategy for\nmaintaining control\
    \ and governance of their keys. The BYOK functionality is one option.\n**Prerequisites**\n\
    - Implementers must do their own due diligence in selecting a source\ncode scanner\
    \ that integrates with their specific environment.\nMicrosoft documentation references\
    \ an Open Web Application Security Project, [Source Code Analysis Tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools);\
    \ which is a guide to\nthird-party scanners. This baseline does not endorse or\
    \ advise on the selection or\nuse of any specific third-party tool.\n- If BYOK\
    \ is deemed to be a requirement:\n- Power BI Premium is required for BYOK.\n-\
    \ To use BYOK, the Power BI tenant admin must upload data to the Power\nBI service\
    \ from a Power BI Desktop (PBIX) file.\n- RSA keys must be 4096-bit.\n- Enable\
    \ BYOK in the tenant.\n**BYOK Implementation High-Level Steps**\nEnable BYOK at\
    \ the tenant level via PowerShell by first introducing the\nencryption keys created\
    \ and stored in Azure Key Vault to the Power BI\ntenant.\nThen assign these encryption\
    \ keys per Premium capacity for encrypting\ncontent in the capacity.\nTo enable\
    \ bringing the agency's key for Power BI, the high-level\nconfiguration steps\
    \ are as follows:\n1.  Add the Power BI service as a service principal for the\
    \ key vault,\nwith wrap and unwrap permissions.\n2. Create an RSA key with a 4096-bit\
    \ length (or use an existing key of\nthis type), with wrap and unwrap permissions.\n\
    3. To turn on BYOK, Power BI Tenant administrators must use a set of\nPower BI\
    \ [Admin PowerShell\nCmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoftpowerbimgmt.admin/?view=powerbi-ps)\n\
    added to the Power BI Admin Cmdlets.\nFollow detailed steps in Microsoft's [Bring\

    # Appendix C: File Export and Visual Artifact Considerations\nExporting data from\
    \ Power BI to image files and comma-separated value\n(.csv) file format has data\
    \ security implications. For example, if\nrow-level security (RLS) features are\
    \ in use in Power BI, an export to\nimage or .csv could allow a user to inadvertently\
    \ decouple that setting\nand expose data to a party who does not have permissions\
    \ or a need to\nknow that previously secured data. A similar scenario applies\
    \ for\ninformation protection sensitivity labels.\nA message regarding this condition\
    \ is provided in the Power BI tenant\nsettings for the particular types of exports.\n\
    In contrast to this, Power BI applies these protection settings (RLS,\nsensitivity\
    \ labels) when the report data leaves Power BI via a supported\nexport method,\
    \ such as export to Excel, PowerPoint, or PDF, download to\n.pbix, and Save (Desktop).\
    \ In this case, only authorized users will be\nable to open protected files.\n\
    **Copy and Paste Visuals**\nPower BI can allow users to copy and paste visuals\
    \ from Power BI reports\nas static images into external applications. This could\
    \ represent a data\nsecurity risk in some contexts. The agency must evaluate whether\
    \ this\nrepresents risk for its data artifacts and whether to turn this off in\n\
    the Export and Sharing Settings.\n**Related Resources**\n- [Sensitivity labels\

    **Implementation settings**\n1.  In the **Power BI tenant** settings, under **Export\
    \ and sharing\nsettings**, administrators can opt to toggle off both **Export\
    \ reports as\nimage files** and **Export to .csv**.\n2. In the **Power BI tenant**\
    \ settings, under **Export and sharing\nsettings**, administrators can opt to\
    \ toggle off **Copy and paste visuals**.\n**Establishing Private Network Access\
    \ Connections Using Azure Private Link:**\nWhen connecting to Azure services intended\
    \ to supply Power BI datasets,\nagencies should consider connecting their Power\
    \ BI tenant to an Azure\nPrivate Link endpoint and disable public internet access.\n\
    In this configuration, Azure Private Link and Azure Networking private\nendpoints\
    \ are used to send data traffic privately using Microsoft's\nbackbone network\
    \ infrastructure. The data travels the Microsoft private\nnetwork backbone instead\
    \ of going across the Internet.\nUsing private endpoints with Power BI ensures\
    \ that traffic will flow\nover the Azure backbone to a private endpoint for Azure\
    \ cloud-based\nresources.\nWithin this configuration, there is also the capability\
    \ to disable\npublic access to Power BI datasets.\n**High-Level Implementation\
    \ Steps**\n> Note:\n> It is imperative that the VNET and VM are configured before\n\
    disabling public internet access.\n1.  Enable private endpoints for Power BI.\n\
    2. Create a Power BI resource in the Azure portal.\n3. Create a virtual network.\n\
    4. Create a virtual machine (VM).\n5. Create a private endpoint.\n6. Connect to\
    \ a VM using Remote Desktop (RDP).\n7. Access Power BI privately from the virtual\

    ## Best Practices for Service Principals\n- Evaluate whether certificates or secrets\
    \ are a more secure option for\nthe implementation.\n> Note:\n> Microsoft recommends\
    \ certificates over secrets.\n- Use the principle of least privilege in implementing\
    \ service\nprincipals; only provide the ability to create app registrations to\n\
    entities requiring it.\n- Instead of enabling service principals for the entire\
    \ agency,\nimplement for a dedicated security group.\n> Note:\n> This policy is\
    \ only applicable if the setting **Allow service principals to use Power BI APIs**\
    \ is enabled.\n**`TLP:CLEAR`**"

    This setting pertains to the security and development of Power BI

    Embedded content. The Power BI tenant states "For extra security,

    block using ResourceKey-based authentication." This baseline statement

    recommends, but does not mandate, setting ResourceKey-based

    authentication to the blocked state.

    For streaming datasets created using the Power BI service user interface, the
    dataset owner receives a URL including a resource key. This key authorizes the
    requestor to push data into the dataset without using an Microsoft Entra ID OAuth
    bearer token, so please keep in mind the implications of having a secret key in
    the URL when working with this type of dataset and method.

    This setting applies to streaming and PUSH datasets. If ResourceKey-based authentication
    is blocked, users with a resource key will not be allowed to send data to stream
    and PUSH datasets using the API. However, if developers have an approved need
    to leverage this feature, an exception to the policy can be investigated.'

    Service principals are an authentication method that can be used to let an Microsoft
    Entra ID application access Power BI service content and APIs. Power BI supports
    using service principals to manage application identities. Service principals
    use APIs to access tenant-level features, controlled by Power BI service administrators
    and enabled for the entire agency or for agency security groups. Accessing service
    principals can be controlled by creating dedicated security groups for them and
    using these groups in any Power BI tenant level-settings. If service principals
    are employed for Power BI, it is recommended that service principal credentials
    used for encrypting or accessing Power BI be stored in a key vault, with properly
    assigned access policies and regularly reviewed access permissions.

    Several high-level use cases for service principals:

    - Not possible to access a data source using service principals in Power BI (e.g.,
    Azure Table storage).

    - A user''s service principal for accessing the Power BI service (e.g., app.powerbi.com
    and app.powerbigov.us).

    - Power BI Embedded and other users of the Power BI REST APIs to interact with

    Microsoft Defender supports creating IP allow lists intended

    to prevent blocking emails from *specific* senders. However,

    as a result, emails from these senders bypass important security

    mechanisms, such as spam filtering, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and [FROM address

    enforcement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/anti-phishing-from-email-address-validation?view=o365-worldwide#override-from-address-enforcement).

    IP block lists block email from listed IP addresses. Although we have no specific
    guidance on which IP addresses to add, block lists can be used to block mail from
    known spammers.

    IP safe lists are dynamic lists of "known, good senders," which Microsoft sources
    from various third-party subscriptions. As with senders in the allow list, emails
    from these senders bypass important security mechanisms.'

    - If using Microsoft Defender, require Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or 2. These
    are included with

    E5 and G5 and are available as add-ons for E3 and G3.

    Several technologies exist for protecting users from malicious links

    included in emails. For example, Microsoft Defender accomplishes this by

    prepending

    `https://*.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=`

    to any URLs included in emails. By prepending the safe links URL,

    Microsoft can proxy the initial URL through their scanning service.

    Their proxy can perform the following actions:

    - Compare the URL with a block list.

    - Compare the URL with a list of know malicious sites.

    - If the URL points to a downloadable file, apply real-time file

    scanning.

    If all checks pass, the user is redirected to the original URL.

    Microsoft Defender includes link-scanning capabilities. Using Microsoft Defender
    is not strictly required for this purpose; any product fulfilling the requirements
    outlined in this baseline policy group may be used.

    If the agency uses Microsoft Defender to meet this baseline policy group, see
    the following policy of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender
    for Office 365 for additional guidance.

  remediation: 'First, identify any approved senders specific to your agency, e.g.,
    any on-premises mail servers. SPF allows you to indicate approved senders by IP
    address or CIDR range. However, note that SPF allows you to [include](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208#section-5.2)
    the IP addresses indicated by a separate SPF policy, referred to by domain name.
    See [External DNS records required for SPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/external-domain-name-system-records?view=o365-worldwide#external-dns-records-required-for-spf)
    for inclusions required for M365 to send email on behalf of your domain.


    SPF is not configured through the Exchange admin center, but rather via

    DNS records hosted by the agency''s domain. Thus, the exact steps needed

    to set up SPF varies from agency to agency. See [Add or edit an SPF TXT record
    to help prevent email spam (Outlook, Exchange Online) \| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider?view=o365-worldwide#add-or-edit-an-spf-txt-record-to-help-prevent-email-spam-outlook-exchange-online)
    for more details.


    To test your SPF configuration, consider using a web-based tool, such as

    those listed under [How can I validate SPF records for my domain? \| Microsoft
    Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/domains-faq?view=o365-worldwide#how-can-i-validate-spf-records-for-my-domain).

    Additionally, SPF records can be requested using the

    PowerShell tool `Resolve-DnsName`. For example:


    ```

    Resolve-DnsName example.onmicrosoft.com txt

    ```


    If SPF is configured, you will see a response resembling `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com
    -all`

    returned; though by necessity, the contents of the SPF

    policy may vary by agency. In this example, the SPF policy indicates

    the IP addresses listed by the policy for "spf.protection.outlook.com" are

    the only approved senders for "example.onmicrosoft.com." These IPs can be determined

    via an additional SPF lookup, this time for "spf.protection.outlook.com." Ensure
    the IP addresses listed as approved senders for your domains are correct. Additionally,
    ensure that each policy either ends in `-all` or [redirects](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208#section-6.1)
    to one that does; this directive indicates that all IPs that don''t match the
    policy should fail. See [SPF TXT record syntax for Microsoft 365 \| Microsoft
    Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-anti-spoofing?view=o365-worldwide#spf-txt-record-syntax-for-microsoft-365)
