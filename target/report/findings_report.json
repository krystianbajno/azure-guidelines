A DLP policy can be created to\naffect all or some environments or exclude certain environments. The\nmore restrictive policy will be enforced when there is a conflict.\nConnectors can be separated by creating a DLP policy assigning them\nto one of three groups: Business, Non-Business, and Blocked. Connectors\nin different groups cannot be used in the same Power App. Connectors in\nthe Blocked group cannot be used at all. (Note: Some M365 connectors\ncannot be blocked, such as Teams and SharePoint connectors).\nIn the DLP policy, connectors can be configured to restrict read\nand write permissions to the data source/service. Connectors that cannot\nbe blocked cannot be configured. Agencies should evaluate the\nconnectors and configure them to fit agency needs and security\nrequirements. The agency should then create a DLP policy to only allow\nthose connectors to be used in Power Platform.\nWhen the Microsoft Entra ID tenant is created, by default, a Power Platform\nenvironment is created in Power Platform.

For example, the policies require users to perform MFA and originate from a managed device to gain access. These requirements are also enforced for guest users. For these policies to work effectively with guest users, both the home tenant (the one the guest user belongs to) and the resource tenant (the target tenant) may need to configure their Microsoft Entra ID cross-tenant access settings.\n\nMicrosoft’s [Authentication and Conditional Access for External ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/authentication-conditional-access) provides an understanding of how MFA and device claims are passed from the home tenant to the resource tenant. To configure the inbound and outbound cross-tenant access settings in Microsoft Entra External ID, refer to Microsoft’s [Overview: Cross-tenant access with Microsoft Entra External ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/cross-tenant-access-overview).\n\n**`TLP:CLEAR`**",

A source code scanner can\nalso encourage moving discovered credentials to more secure locations,\nsuch as Azure key vault.\nStore encryption keys or service principal credentials used for\nencrypting or accessing Power BI in a Key Vault, assign proper access\npolicies to the vault, and regularly review access permissions.\nFor regulatory or other compliance reasons, some agencies may need to\nuse BYOK, which is supported by Power BI. By default,\nPower BI uses Microsoft-managed keys to encrypt the data. In Power BI\nPremium, users can use their own keys for data at-rest imported\ninto a dataset. See [Data source and storage\nconsiderations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/service-encryption-byok#data-source-and-storage-considerations)\nfor more information.\n- For Power BI embedded applications, a best practice is to implement a\nsource code scanning solution to identify credentials within the code\nof the app housing the embedded Power BI report(s).\n- If required under specific regulations, agencies need a strategy for\nmaintaining control and governance of their keys. The BYOK functionality is one option.\n**Prerequisites**\n- Implementers must do their own due diligence in selecting a source\ncode scanner that integrates with their specific environment.\nMicrosoft documentation references an Open Web Application Security Project, [Source Code Analysis Tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools); which is a guide to\nthird-party scanners. This baseline does not endorse or advise on the selection or\nuse of any specific third-party tool.\n- If BYOK is deemed to be a requirement:\n- Power BI Premium is required for BYOK.\n- To use BYOK, the Power BI tenant admin must upload data to the Power\nBI service from a Power BI Desktop (PBIX) file.\n- RSA keys must be 4096-bit.\n- Enable BYOK in the tenant.\n**BYOK Implementation High-Level Steps**\nEnable BYOK at the tenant level via PowerShell by first introducing the\nencryption keys created and stored in Azure Key Vault to the Power BI\ntenant.\nThen assign these encryption keys per Premium capacity for encrypting\ncontent in the capacity.\nTo enable bringing the agency's key for Power BI, the high-level\nconfiguration steps are as follows:\n1.  Add the Power BI service as a service principal for the key vault,\nwith wrap and unwrap permissions.\n2. Create an RSA key with a 4096-bit length (or use an existing key of\nthis type), with wrap and unwrap permissions.\n3. To turn on BYOK, Power BI Tenant administrators must use a set of\nPower BI [Admin PowerShell\nCmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoftpowerbimgmt.admin/?view=powerbi-ps)\nadded to the Power BI Admin Cmdlets.\nFollow detailed steps in Microsoft's [Bring your own encryption keys for Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/service-encryption-byok)\nfrom Microsoft.\n**Related Resources**\n- [Bring your own encryption keys for Power BI \\| Microsoft\nLearn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/service-encryption-byok)\n- [Microsoft Security DevOps Azure DevOps extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/azure-devops-extension)\n- For GitHub, the agency can use the native secret scanning feature to\nidentify credentials or other form of secrets within code at [About\nsecret scanning \\| GitHub\ndocs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning)\n- [Announcing General Availability of Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) for\nPower BI\nPremium](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-general-availability-of-bring-your-own-key-byok-for-power-bi-premium/)\n# Appendix C: File Export and Visual Artifact Considerations\nExporting data from Power BI to image files and comma-separated value\n(.csv) file format has data security implications. For example, if\nrow-level security (RLS) features are in use in Power BI, an export to\nimage or .csv could allow a user to inadvertently decouple that setting\nand expose data to a party who does not have permissions or a need to\nknow that previously secured data. A similar scenario applies for\ninformation protection sensitivity labels.\nA message regarding this condition is provided in the Power BI tenant\nsettings for the particular types of exports.\nIn contrast to this, Power BI applies these protection settings (RLS,\nsensitivity labels) when the report data leaves Power BI via a supported\nexport method, such as export to Excel, PowerPoint, or PDF, download to\n.pbix, and Save (Desktop). In this case, only authorized users will be\nable to open protected files.\n**Copy and Paste Visuals**\nPower BI can allow users to copy and paste visuals from Power BI reports\nas static images into external applications. This could represent a data\nsecurity risk in some contexts. The agency must evaluate whether this\nrepresents risk for its data artifacts and whether to turn this off in\nthe Export and Sharing Settings.\n**Related Resources**\n- [Sensitivity labels in Power BI \\| Microsoft\nLearn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/service-security-sensitivity-label-overview)\n- [Say No to Export Data, Yes to Analyze in\nExcel](https://radacad.com/say-no-to-export-data-yes-to-analyze-in-excel-power-bi-and-excel-can-talk)\n- [Power BI Governance – Why you should consider disabling Export to\nExcel](https://data-marc.com/2020/04/13/power-bi-governance-why-you-should-consider-to-disable-export-to-excel/)\n**Implementation settings**\n1.  In the **Power BI tenant** settings, under **Export and sharing\nsettings**, administrators can opt to toggle off both **Export reports as\nimage files** and **Export to .csv**.\n2. In the **Power BI tenant** settings, under **Export and sharing\nsettings**, administrators can opt to toggle off **Copy and paste visuals**.\n**Establishing Private Network Access Connections Using Azure Private Link:**\nWhen connecting to Azure services intended to supply Power BI datasets,\nagencies should consider connecting their Power BI tenant to an Azure\nPrivate Link endpoint and disable public internet access.\nIn this configuration, Azure Private Link and Azure Networking private\nendpoints are used to send data traffic privately using Microsoft's\nbackbone network infrastructure. The data travels the Microsoft private\nnetwork backbone instead of going across the Internet.\nUsing private endpoints with Power BI ensures that traffic will flow\nover the Azure backbone to a private endpoint for Azure cloud-based\nresources.\nWithin this configuration, there is also the capability to disable\npublic access to Power BI datasets.\n**High-Level Implementation Steps**\n> Note:\n> It is imperative that the VNET and VM are configured before\ndisabling public internet access.\n1.  Enable private endpoints for Power BI.\n2. Create a Power BI resource in the Azure portal.\n3. Create a virtual network.\n4. Create a virtual machine (VM).\n5. Create a private endpoint.\n6. Connect to a VM using Remote Desktop (RDP).\n7. Access Power BI privately from the virtual machine.\n8. Disable public access for Power BI.\n**Related Resources**\n- [Private endpoints for secure access to Power BI  \\| Microsoft\nLearn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/service-security-private-links)\n- [Azure security baseline for Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/power-bi-security-baseline)\n## Best Practices for Service Principals\n- Evaluate whether certificates or secrets are a more secure option for\nthe implementation.\n> Note:\n> Microsoft recommends certificates over secrets.\n- Use the principle of least privilege in implementing service\nprincipals; only provide the ability to create app registrations to\nentities requiring it.\n- Instead of enabling service principals for the entire agency,\nimplement for a dedicated security group.\n> Note:\n> This policy is only applicable if the setting **Allow service principals to use Power BI APIs** is enabled.\n**`TLP:CLEAR`**",

Service principals use APIs to access tenant-level features, controlled by Power BI service administrators and enabled for the entire agency or for agency security groups. Accessing service principals can be controlled by creating dedicated security groups for them and using these groups in any Power BI tenant level-settings. If service principals are employed for Power BI, it is recommended that service principal credentials used for encrypting or accessing Power BI be stored in a key vault, with properly assigned access policies and regularly reviewed access permissions.\nSeveral high-level use cases for service principals:\n- Not possible to access a data source using service principals in Power BI (e.g., Azure Table storage).\n- A user's service principal for accessing the Power BI service (e.g., app.powerbi.com and app.powerbigov.us).\n- Power BI Embedded and other users of the Power BI REST APIs to interact with Power BI content.",

For example, Microsoft Defender accomplishes this by\nprepending\n`https://*.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=`\nto any URLs included in emails. By prepending the safe links URL,\nMicrosoft can proxy the initial URL through their scanning service.\nTheir proxy can perform the following actions:\n- Compare the URL with a block list.\n- Compare the URL with a list of know malicious sites.\n- If the URL points to a downloadable file, apply real-time file\nscanning.\nIf all checks pass, the user is redirected to the original URL.\nMicrosoft Defender includes link-scanning capabilities. Using Microsoft Defender is not strictly required for this purpose; any product fulfilling the requirements outlined in this baseline policy group may be used.\nIf the agency uses Microsoft Defender to meet this baseline policy group, see the following policy of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365 for additional guidance.\n- [MS.DEFENDER.1.3v1 \\| CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365](./defender.md#msdefender13v1).\n- All users SHALL be added to Defender for Office 365 Protection in either the standard or strict preset security policy.",

        "remediation": "First, identify any approved senders specific to your agency, e.g., any on-premises mail servers. SPF allows you to indicate approved senders by IP address or CIDR range. However, note that SPF allows you to [include](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208#section-5.2) the IP addresses indicated by a separate SPF policy, referred to by domain name. See [External DNS records required for SPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/external-domain-name-system-records?view=o365-worldwide#external-dns-records-required-for-spf) for inclusions required for M365 to send email on behalf of your domain.\n\nSPF is not configured through the Exchange admin center, but rather via\nDNS records hosted by the agency's domain. Thus, the exact steps needed\nto set up SPF varies from agency to agency. See [Add or edit an SPF TXT record to help prevent email spam (Outlook, Exchange Online) \\| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider?view=o365-worldwide#add-or-edit-an-spf-txt-record-to-help-prevent-email-spam-outlook-exchange-online) for more details.\n\nTo test your SPF configuration, consider using a web-based tool, such as\nthose listed under [How can I validate SPF records for my domain? \\| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/domains-faq?view=o365-worldwide#how-can-i-validate-spf-records-for-my-domain).\nAdditionally, SPF records can be requested using the\nPowerShell tool `Resolve-DnsName`. For example:\n\n```\nResolve-DnsName example.onmicrosoft.com txt\n```\n\nIf SPF is configured, you will see a response resembling `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all`\nreturned; though by necessity, the contents of the SPF\npolicy may vary by agency. In this example, the SPF policy indicates\nthe IP addresses listed by the policy for \"spf.protection.outlook.com\" are\nthe only approved senders for \"example.onmicrosoft.com.\" These IPs can be determined\nvia an additional SPF lookup, this time for \"spf.protection.outlook.com.\" Ensure the IP addresses listed as approved senders for your domains are correct. Additionally, ensure that each policy either ends in `-all` or [redirects](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208#section-6.1) to one that does; this directive indicates that all IPs that don't match the policy should fail. See [SPF TXT record syntax for Microsoft 365 \\| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-anti-spoofing?view=o365-worldwide#spf-txt-record-syntax-for-microsoft-365) for a more in-depth discussion\nof SPF record syntax.",
