To secure Power Platform environments, DLP
policies can be created to restrict the connectors used with
Power Apps created in an environment. A DLP policy can be created to
affect all or some environments or exclude certain environments. The
more restrictive policy will be enforced when there is a conflict.
Connectors can be separated by creating a DLP policy assigning them
to one of three groups: Business, Non-Business, and Blocked. Connectors
in different groups cannot be used in the same Power App. Connectors in
the Blocked group cannot be used at all. (Note: Some M365 connectors
cannot be blocked, such as Teams and SharePoint connectors).
In the DLP policy, connectors can be configured to restrict read
and write permissions to the data source/service. Connectors that cannot
be blocked cannot be configured. Agencies should evaluate the
connectors and configure them to fit agency needs and security
requirements. The agency should then create a DLP policy to only allow
those connectors to be used in Power Platform.

Data loss prevention (DLP) helps prevent both accidental leakage of
sensitive information as well as intentional exfiltration of data. DLP
forms an integral part of securing Microsoft Teams. There are
several commercial DLP solutions available documenting support for
M365. Microsoft itself offers DLP services, controlled within the Microsoft Purview
compliance portal. Agencies may select any service that fits their needs and meets
the requirements outlined in this baseline setting. The DLP solution selected by an agency
should offer services comparable to those offered by Microsoft.
Though using Microsoft's DLP solution is not strictly
required, guidance for configuring Microsoft's DLP solution can be found in following section of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365.

Several technologies exist for protecting users from malicious links
included in emails. For example, Microsoft Defender accomplishes this by
prepending:
`https://*.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=`
to any URLs included in emails. By prepending the safe links URL,
Microsoft can proxy the initial URL through their scanning service.
Their proxy can perform the following actions:
- Compare the URL with a block list.
- Compare the URL with a list of know malicious sites.
- If the URL points to a downloadable file, apply real-time file
scanning.
If all checks pass, the user is redirected to the original URL.

Platform. Power Platform tenant isolation only works for connectors
using Microsoft Entra-based authentication, such as Office 365 Outlook or

isolation set to **Off**, allowing for cross-tenant connections to
be established. A user from tenant A using a Power App with a connector
can seamlessly establish a connection to tenant B if using appropriate
Microsoft Entra ID credentials.
If admins want to allow only a select set of tenants to establish
connections to or from their tenant, they can turn on tenant isolation.

disabled, external users will still be able to join Teams calls,
assuming anonymous join is enabled. Depending on agency need, if both
external access and anonymous join are blocked—neither required

sensitive information and associates a default confidence level with
this detection based on the sensitive information type matched.

service description](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/information-protection/) for
details.
- Microsoft Purview Information Protection sensitivity labels need to be migrated to
the Microsoft Information Protection Unified Labeling platform to be
used in Power BI.
- To apply labels to Power BI content and files, a user must
have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license, in addition to
one of the previously mentioned Azure Information Protection licenses.
- Before enabling sensitivity labels on the agency's tenant, ensure sensitivity labels have been defined and published for relevant
users and groups. See [Create and configure sensitivity labels and
their
policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/create-sensitivity-labels)
for detail.
Several best practices and approaches are available to protect sensitive
data in Power BI:
- Leverage sensitivity labels via Microsoft Purview Information Protection.
- Power BI allows service users to bring their own key to protect data
at rest.
- Customers have the option to keep data sources on-premises and
leverage Direct Query or Live Connect with an on-premises data gateway
to minimize data exposure to the cloud service.
- Implement row-level security in Power BI datasets.
**Implementation Steps**
**Apply sensitivity labels from data sources to their data in Power BI**
When this setting is enabled, Power BI datasets that connect to
sensitivity-labeled data in supported data sources can inherit those
labels, so the data remains classified and secure when brought into
Power BI. For details about sensitivity label inheritance from data
sources, see below:
***To enable sensitivity label inheritance from data sources:***
1.  Navigate to the Power BI tenant settings.
2. Select **Information protection** -\> **Apply sensitivity labels
from data sources to their data in Power BI (preview).**
3. Enable **Restrict content with protected labels from being shared
via link with everyone in your agency**.
When this setting is enabled, users can't generate a sharing link for
people in the agency for content with protection settings in the
sensitivity label.
Sensitivity labels with protection settings include encryption or
content markings. For example, the agency may have a ""Highly
Confidential"" label that includes encryption and applies a ""Highly
Confidential"" watermark to content with this label. When this
tenant setting is enabled and a report has a sensitivity label with
protection settings, then users cannot create sharing links for people in
the agency.
**Information Protection Prerequisites Specific to Power BI**
- An Microsoft Purview Information Protection Premium P1 or Premium P2 license is
required to apply or view Microsoft Purview Information Protection sensitivity
labels in Power BI. Microsoft Purview Information Protection can be purchased
either standalone or through one of the Microsoft licensing suites.
See [Microsoft Purview Information Protection
service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/azure-information-protection) description for
details.
- Microsoft Purview Information Protection sensitivity labels need to be migrated to
the Microsoft Information Protection Unified Labeling platform in
order for them to be used in Power BI.
- To be able to apply labels to Power BI content and files, a user must
have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license in addition to
one of the previously mentioned Azure Information Protection licenses.
- Before enabling sensitivity labels on the agency's tenant, make sure
that sensitivity labels have been defined and published for relevant
users and groups. See [Create and configure sensitivity labels and
their
policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/create-sensitivity-labels)
for detail.
**High-Level Steps to Use Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) Feature in Power

# Appendix B: Source Code and Credential Security Considerations
Exposing secrets via collaboration spaces is a security concern when
using Power BI.
For Power BI embedded applications, it is recommended to implement a
source code scanning solution to identify credentials within the code of
any app housing embedded Power BI report(s). A source code scanner can
also encourage moving discovered credentials to more secure locations,
such as Azure key vault.
Store encryption keys or service principal credentials used for
encrypting or accessing Power BI in a Key Vault, assign proper access
policies to the vault, and regularly review access permissions.
For regulatory or other compliance reasons, some agencies may need to
use BYOK, which is supported by Power BI. By default,
Power BI uses Microsoft-managed keys to encrypt the data. In Power BI
Premium, users can use their own keys for data at-rest imported
into a dataset. See [Data source and storage
considerations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/service-encryption-byok#data-source-and-storage-considerations)
for more information.
- For Power BI embedded applications, a best practice is to implement a
source code scanning solution to identify credentials within the code
of the app housing the embedded Power BI report(s).
- If required under specific regulations, agencies need a strategy for
maintaining control and governance of their keys. The BYOK functionality is one option.
**Prerequisites**
- Implementers must do their own due diligence in selecting a source
code scanner that integrates with their specific environment.
Microsoft documentation references an Open Web Application Security Project, [Source Code Analysis Tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools); which is a guide to
third-party scanners. This baseline does not endorse or advise on the selection or
use of any specific third-party tool.
- If BYOK is deemed to be a requirement:
- Power BI Premium is required for BYOK.
- To use BYOK, the Power BI tenant admin must upload data to the Power
BI service from a Power BI Desktop (PBIX) file.
- RSA keys must be 4096-bit.
- Enable BYOK in the tenant.
**BYOK Implementation High-Level Steps**
Enable BYOK at the tenant level via PowerShell by first introducing the
encryption keys created and stored in Azure Key Vault to the Power BI
tenant.
Then assign these encryption keys per Premium capacity for encrypting
content in the capacity.
To enable bringing the agency's key for Power BI, the high-level
configuration steps are as follows:
1.  Add the Power BI service as a service principal for the key vault,
with wrap and unwrap permissions.
2. Create an RSA key with a 4096-bit length (or use an existing key of
this type), with wrap and unwrap permissions.
3. To turn on BYOK, Power BI Tenant administrators must use a set of
Power BI [Admin PowerShell
Cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoftpowerbimgmt.admin/?view=powerbi-ps)
added to the Power BI Admin Cmdlets.
Follow detailed steps in Microsoft's [Bring your own encryption keys for Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/service-encryption-byok)
from Microsoft.

# Appendix C: File Export and Visual Artifact Considerations
Exporting data from Power BI to image files and comma-separated value
(.csv) file format has data security implications. For example, if
row-level security (RLS) features are in use in Power BI, an export to
image or .csv could allow a user to inadvertently decouple that setting
and expose data to a party who does not have permissions or a need to
know that previously secured data. A similar scenario applies for
information protection sensitivity labels.
A message regarding this condition is provided in the Power BI tenant
settings for the particular types of exports.
In contrast to this, Power BI applies these protection settings (RLS,
sensitivity labels) when the report data leaves Power BI via a supported
export method, such as export to Excel, PowerPoint, or PDF, download to
.pbix, and Save (Desktop). In this case, only authorized users will be
able to open protected files.
**Copy and Paste Visuals**
Power BI can allow users to copy and paste visuals from Power BI reports
as static images into external applications. This could represent a data
security risk in some contexts. The agency must evaluate whether this
represents risk for its data artifacts and whether to turn this off in
the Export and Sharing Settings.

Excel](https://data-marc.com/2020/04/13/power-bi-governance-why-you-should-consider-to-disable-export-to-excel/)
**Implementation settings**
1.  In the **Power BI tenant** settings, under **Export and sharing
settings**, administrators can opt to toggle off both **Export reports as
image files** and **Export to .csv**.
2. In the **Power BI tenant** settings, under **Export and sharing
settings**, administrators can opt to toggle off **Copy and paste visuals**.
**Establishing Private Network Access Connections Using Azure Private Link:**
When connecting to Azure services intended to supply Power BI datasets,
agencies should consider connecting their Power BI tenant to an Azure
Private Link endpoint and disable public internet access.
In this configuration, Azure Private Link and Azure Networking private
endpoints are used to send data traffic privately using Microsoft's
backbone network infrastructure. The data travels the Microsoft private
network backbone instead of going across the Internet.
Using private endpoints with Power BI ensures that traffic will flow
over the Azure backbone to a private endpoint for Azure cloud-based
resources.
Within this configuration, there is also the capability to disable
public access to Power BI datasets.
**High-Level Implementation Steps**
> Note:
> It is imperative that the VNET and VM are configured before
disabling public internet access.
1.  Enable private endpoints for Power BI.
2. Create a Power BI resource in the Azure portal.
3. Create a virtual network.
4. Create a virtual machine (VM).
5. Create a private endpoint.
6. Connect to a VM using Remote Desktop (RDP).
7. Access Power BI privately from the virtual machine.
8. Disable public access for Power BI.

## Best Practices for Service Principals
- Evaluate whether certificates or secrets are a more secure option for
the implementation.
> Note:
> Microsoft recommends certificates over secrets.
- Use the principle of least privilege in implementing service
principals; only provide the ability to create app registrations to
entities requiring it.
- Instead of enabling service principals for the entire agency,
implement for a dedicated security group.

Service principals are an authentication method that can be used to let an Microsoft Entra ID application access Power BI service content and APIs. Power BI supports using service principals to manage application identities. Service principals use APIs to access tenant-level features, controlled by Power BI service administrators and enabled for the entire agency or for agency security groups. Accessing service principals can be controlled by creating dedicated security groups for them and using these groups in any Power BI tenant level-settings. If service principals are employed for Power BI, it is recommended that service principal credentials used for encrypting or accessing Power BI be stored in a key vault, with properly assigned access policies and regularly reviewed access permissions.
Several high-level use cases for service principals:
- Not possible to access a data source using service principals in Power BI (e.g., Azure Table storage).
- A user's service principal for accessing the Power BI service (e.g., app.powerbi.com and app.powerbigov.us).

As of November 14, 2023, anti-phishing for user and domain impersonation and spoof intelligence are not yet available in M365 Government Community Cloud High (GCC High) and M365 Department of Defense (DOD). See [Platform
features \| Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/office-365-us-government#platform-features)
for current offerings.
Microsoft Defender supports creating IP allow lists intended
to prevent blocking emails from *specific* senders. However,
as a result, emails from these senders bypass important security
mechanisms, such as spam filtering, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and [FROM address
enforcement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/anti-phishing-from-email-address-validation?view=o365-worldwide#override-from-address-enforcement).
IP block lists block email from listed IP addresses. Although we have no specific guidance on which IP addresses to add, block lists can be used to block mail from known spammers.
IP safe lists are dynamic lists of ""known, good senders,"" which Microsoft sources from various third-party subscriptions. As with senders in the allow list, emails from these senders bypass important security mechanisms."

Managing and monitoring Exchange mailboxes and user activity requires a means
to define activity of concern and notify administrators.  Alerts can be
generated to help identify suspicious or malicious activity in Exchange Online.
These alerts give administrators better real-time insight into possible
security incidents.
Using Microsoft 365 alert policies is not strictly required for this purpose;
any product fulfilling the requirements outlined in this baseline policy
group may be used. If the agency uses Microsoft 365 alert policies, this
includes several prebuilt alert policies, many of which pertain to Exchange
Online. Guidance for configuring alerts in Microsoft 365 is
given in the following section of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline
for Defender for Office 365.

- If using Microsoft Defender, require Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or 2. These are included with
E5 and G5 and are available as add-ons for E3 and G3.
Several technologies exist for protecting users from malicious links
included in emails. For example, Microsoft Defender accomplishes this by
prepending
`https://*.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=`
to any URLs included in emails. By prepending the safe links URL,
Microsoft can proxy the initial URL through their scanning service.
Their proxy can perform the following actions:
- Compare the URL with a block list.
- Compare the URL with a list of know malicious sites.
- If the URL points to a downloadable file, apply real-time file
scanning.
If all checks pass, the user is redirected to the original URL.
Microsoft Defender includes link-scanning capabilities. Using Microsoft Defender is not strictly required for this purpose; any product fulfilling the requirements outlined in this baseline policy group may be used.
If the agency uses Microsoft Defender to meet this baseline policy group, see the following policy of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365 for additional guidance.
