        rationale: Sharing information outside the organization via SharePoint increases
          the risk of unauthorized access. By limiting external sharing, administrators
          decrease the risk of access to information.

        remediation: 'Note: If SharePoint external sharing is set to its most restrictive
          setting of "Only people in your organization", then no external sharing
          is allowed and no implementation changes are required for this policy item.

        rationale: By limiting sharing to domains or approved security groups used

          - N/A

          Sharing files with external users via the usage of **Anyone links** or **Verification
          codes** is strongly discouraged because it provides access to data within
          a tenant with weak or no authentication. If these features are used, this
          section details some access restrictions that could provide limited security
          risk mitigations.

          **Note**: The settings in this section are only applicable if an agency
          is using **Anyone links** or **Verification code** sharing. See each policy
          below for details.'

          by default for sharing links to **View**.


          4. Select **Save**.'
        rationale: Edit access to files and folders could allow a user to make unauthorized
          changes.  By restricting default permissions to **View**, administrators
          prevent unintended or malicious modification.

        rationale: Links may be used to provide access to information for a short
          period of time. Without expiration, however, access is indefinite. By setting

          access to information.
