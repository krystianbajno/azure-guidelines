          This section provides policies that reduce security risks related to potentially
          compromised user accounts. These policies combine Microsoft Entra ID Protection
          and Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access. Microsoft Entra ID Protection
          uses numerous signals to detect the risk level for each user or sign-in
          and determine if an account may have been compromised.

          - _Additional mitigations to reduce risks associated with the authentication
          of workload identities:_ Although not covered in this baseline due to the
          need for an additional non-standard license, Microsoft provides support
          for mitigating risks related to workload identities (Microsoft Entra ID
          applications or service principals). Agencies should strongly consider implementing
          this feature because workload identities present many of the same risks
          as interactive user access and are commonly used in modern systems. CISA
          urges organizations to [apply Conditional Access policies to workload identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/workload-identity).'
        remediation: "1. [Determine if an agency’s existing applications use legacy\
          \ authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication#identify-legacy-authentication-use)\
          \ before blocking legacy authentication across the entire application base.\n\
          \n2. Create a Conditional Access policy to block legacy authentication\n\
          \n<pre>\n  Users > Include > <b>All users</b>\n\n  Target resources > Cloud\
          \ apps >  Include > <b>All cloud apps</b>\n\n  Conditions > Client apps\
          \ > Configure > <b>Yes</b> > Legacy authentication clients > Select only\
          \ <b>Exchange ActiveSync clients</b> and <b>Other clients</b>\n\n  Access\
          \ controls > Grant > <b>Block Access</b>\n</pre>"
        rationale: The security risk of allowing legacy authentication protocols is
          they do not support MFA. Blocking legacy protocols reduces the impact of
          user credential theft.
        notes:
        - In this section, the term ["high risk"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks)
          denotes the risk level applied by the Microsoft Entra ID Protection service
          to a user account or sign-in event.

        rationale: Blocking high-risk users may prevent compromised accounts from

        notes:
        - Users identified as high risk by Microsoft Entra ID Identity Protection
          can be blocked from accessing the system via a Microsoft Entra ID Conditional
          Access policy. A high-risk user will be blocked until an administrator remediates
          their account.

          This section provides policies that help reduce security risks related to
          user authentication and registration.

          Phishing-resistant MFA is required per [Office of Management and Budget
          Memorandum 22-09](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf),
          but for a variety of reasons, implementing it for all users may be challenging.
          This section provides additional backup security policies to mitigate risk
          associated with lesser forms of MFA. For example, Policy MS.AAD.3.2v1 below
          enforces MFA without stipulating the specific MFA method.

          <img src="/images/aad-mfa.png"

          alt="Weak MFA methods are SMS and Voice. Stronger MFA are Authenticator
          Push Notifications, Authenticator Phone Sign-in, Software Tokens OTP, and
          Hardware Tokens OTP. Strongest MFA methods are FIDO2 (preferred), Windows
          Hello (preferred), Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (preferred)
          and federated PIV card." />

          Figure 1: Depiction of MFA methods from weakest to strongest. _Adapted from
          [Microsoft Page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods)_'

        rationale: This prevents compromised accounts from accessing the tenant.

          The phishing-resistant methods **Microsoft Entra ID certificate-based authentication
          (CBA)**, **FIDO2 Security Key**, **Windows Hello for Business**, and **device-bound
          passkeys** (in the authenticator app of choice) are the recommended authentication
          options since they offer forms of MFA with the least weaknesses. For federal
          agencies, Microsoft Entra ID CBA supports federal PIV card authentication
          directly to Microsoft Entra ID.

          If on-premises PIV authentication and federation to Microsoft Entra ID is
          used, [enforce PIV logon via Microsoft Active Directory group policy](https://www.idmanagement.gov/implement/scl-windows/).'

        rationale: Weaker forms of MFA do not protect against sophisticated phishing
          attacks. By enforcing methods resistant to phishing, those risks are minimized.

          - An Azure subscription may be required to send logs to an external system,
          such as the agency''s Security Information and Event Management (SIEM).

          This section provides policies that help reduce security risk of malicious
          applications or service principals added to the tenant by non-privileged
          users. Malicious applications can perform many of the same operations as
          interactive users and can access data on behalf of compromised users. These
          policies apply to custom-developed applications and applications published
          by third-party vendors.'
        remediation: Follow the configuration instructions unique to the products
          and integration patterns at your organization to send the security logs
          to the security operations center for monitoring.
        rationale: The security risk of not having visibility into cyber attacks is
          reduced by collecting logs in the agency’s centralized security detection
          infrastructure. This makes security events available for auditing, query,
          and incident response.
        notes:
        - 'The following Microsoft Entra ID logs (configured in diagnostic settings),
          are required: `AuditLogs, SignInLogs, RiskyUsers, UserRiskEvents, NonInteractiveUserSignInLogs,
          ServicePrincipalSignInLogs, ADFSSignInLogs, RiskyServicePrincipals, ServicePrincipalRiskEvents,
          EnrichedOffice365AuditLogs, MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs`. If managed identities
          are used for Azure resources, also send the `ManagedIdentitySignInLogs`
          log type. If the Microsoft Entra ID Provisioning Service is used to provision
          users to software-as-a-service (SaaS) apps or other systems, also send the
          `ProvisioningLogs` log type.'
        - Agencies can benefit from security detection capabilities offered by the
          CISA Cloud Log Aggregation Warehouse (CLAW) system. Agencies are urged to
          send the logs to CLAW. Contact CISA at cyberliason@cisa.dhs.gov to request
          integration instructions.

          This section provides policies that help reduce security risks related to
          the usage of [highly privileged Microsoft Entra ID built-in roles](#highly-privileged-roles).
          Privileged administrative users have access to operations that can undermine
          the security of the tenant by changing configurations and security policies.
          Special protections are necessary to secure this level of access.

          Some of the policy implementations in this section reference specific features
          of the Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Identity Management (PIM) service that
          provides Privileged Access Management (PAM) capabilities. As an alternative
          to Microsoft Entra ID PIM, third-party products and services with equivalent
          PAM capabilities can be leveraged.'
        remediation: 1. [Configure the **Password expiration policy** to **Set passwords
          to never expire**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/set-password-expiration-policy?view=o365-worldwide#set-password-expiration-policy).
        rationale: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), OMB,
          and Microsoft have published guidance indicating mandated periodic password
          changes make user accounts less secure. For example, OMB-22-09 states, "Password
          policies must not require use of special characters or regular rotation."

        description: A minimum of two users and a maximum of eight users SHALL be

        remediation: 'When counting the number of users assigned to the Global Administrator
          role, count each user only once.


          1. In **Microsoft Entra admin center**  count the number of users assigned
          to the **Global Administrator** role. Count users that are assigned directly
          to the role and users assigned via group membership. If you have Microsoft
          Entra ID PIM, count both the **Eligible assignments** and **Active assignments**.
          If any of the groups assigned to Global Administrator are enrolled in PIM
          for Groups, also count the number of group members from the PIM for Groups
          portal **Eligible** assignments.


          2. Validate that there are a total of two to eight users assigned to the
          Global Administrator role.'
        rationale: The Global Administrator role provides unfettered access to the
          tenant. Limiting the number of users with this level of access makes tenant
          compromise more challenging. Microsoft recommends fewer than five users
          in the Global Administrator role. However, additional user accounts, up
          to eight, may be necessary to support emergency access and some operational
          scenarios.

        remediation: 'This policy is based on the ratio below:


          `X = (Number of users assigned to the Global Administrator role) / (Number
          of users assigned to other highly privileged roles)`


          1. Follow the instructions for policy MS.AAD.7.1v1 above to get a count
          of users assigned to the Global Administrator role.


          2. Follow the instructions for policy MS.AAD.7.1v1 above but get a count
          of users assigned to the other highly privileged roles (not Global Administrator).
          If a user is assigned to both Global Administrator and other roles, only
          count that user for the Global Administrator assignment.


          3. Divide the value from step 2 from the value from step 1 to calculate
          X. If X is less than or equal to 1 then the tenant is compliant with the
          policy.'
        rationale: Many privileged administrative users do not need unfettered access
          to the tenant to perform their duties. By assigning them to roles based
          on least privilege, the risks associated with having their accounts compromised
          are reduced.

        rationale: By provisioning cloud-only Microsoft Entra ID user accounts to
          privileged users, the risks associated with a compromise of on-premises

        remediation: '1. In **Microsoft Entra admin center**  select **Roles and administrators**.
          Perform the steps below for each highly privileged role. We reference the

          system. If a group is identified and it is enrolled in PIM for Groups, see
          the exception cases below for details.


          Exception cases:

          - Emergency access accounts that require perpetual active assignment.

          - Service accounts that require perpetual active assignment.

          - If using PIM for Groups, a group that is enrolled in PIM is allowed to
          have a perpetual active assignment to a role because activation is handled

        rationale: Instead of giving users permanent assignments to privileged roles,
          provisioning access just in time lessens exposure if those accounts become
          compromised. In Microsoft Entra ID PIM or an alternative PAM system, just
          in time access can be provisioned by assigning users to roles as eligible
          instead of perpetually active.

        rationale: Provisioning users to privileged roles within a PAM system enables
          enforcement of numerous privileged access policies and monitoring. If privileged

          require a Microsoft Entra ID P2 license; however, a third-party Privileged
          Access Management (PAM) solution may also be used to satisfy the requirements.
          If a third-party solution is used, then a P2 license is not required for
          the respective policies.

          This section provides policies that help reduce security risks related to
          integrating M365 guest users. A guest user is a specific type of external
          user who belongs to a separate organization but can access files, meetings,
          Teams, and other data in the target tenant. It is common to invite guest
          users to a tenant for cross-agency collaboration purposes.'
        remediation: "1. Follow the same instructions as MS.AAD.7.8v1 for each of\
          \ the highly privileged roles (other than Global Administrator) but enter\
          \ a security monitoring mailbox different from the one used to monitor Global\
          \ Administrator activations.\n\n 2. For each of the highly privileged roles,\
          \ if they have any PIM groups actively assigned to them, then also apply\
          \ the same configurations per step 1 to each PIM group's **Member** settings."
        rationale: Closely monitor activation of high-risk roles for signs of compromise.
          Send activation alerts to enable the security monitoring team to detect
          compromise attempts. In some environments, activating privileged roles can
          generate a significant number of alerts.

          account become compromised or be created by an adversary.

          \nSome of the conditional access policies contained in this security baseline,\
          \ if implemented as described, will impact guest user access to a tenant.\
          \ For example, the policies require users to perform MFA and originate from\
          \ a managed device to gain access. These requirements are also enforced\
          \ for guest users. For these policies to work effectively with guest users,\
          \ both the home tenant (the one the guest user belongs to) and the resource\
          \ tenant (the target tenant) may need to configure their Microsoft Entra\
          \ ID cross-tenant access settings.\n\nMicrosoft’s [Authentication and Conditional\
          \ Access for External ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/authentication-conditional-access)\
          \ provides an understanding of how MFA and device claims are passed from\
          \ the home tenant to the resource tenant. To configure the inbound and outbound\
          \ cross-tenant access settings in Microsoft Entra External ID, refer to\
          \ Microsoft’s [Overview: Cross-tenant access with Microsoft Entra External\
          \ ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/cross-tenant-access-overview).\n\
          \n**`TLP:CLEAR`**"
        rationale: Limiting which domains can be invited to create guest accounts
          in the tenant helps reduce the risk of users from unauthorized external
          organizations getting access.
