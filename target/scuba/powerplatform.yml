          To secure Power Platform environments, DLP

          policies can be created to restrict the connectors used with

          Power Apps created in an environment. A DLP policy can be created to

          affect all or some environments or exclude certain environments. The

          more restrictive policy will be enforced when there is a conflict.

          Connectors can be separated by creating a DLP policy assigning them

          to one of three groups: Business, Non-Business, and Blocked. Connectors

          in different groups cannot be used in the same Power App. Connectors in

          the Blocked group cannot be used at all. (Note: Some M365 connectors

          cannot be blocked, such as Teams and SharePoint connectors).

          In the DLP policy, connectors can be configured to restrict read

          and write permissions to the data source/service. Connectors that cannot

          be blocked cannot be configured. Agencies should evaluate the

          connectors and configure them to fit agency needs and security

          requirements. The agency should then create a DLP policy to only allow

          those connectors to be used in Power Platform.

          When the Microsoft Entra ID tenant is created, by default, a Power Platform

          environment is created in Power Platform. This Power Platform

          environment will bear the name of the tenant. There is no way to

          restrict users in the Microsoft Entra ID tenant from creating Power Apps
          in the

          default Power Platform environment. Admins can restrict users from

          creating apps in all other created environments.'

          **3**.


          2.  Under **Who can create trial environments**, select **Only specific

        rationale: Users creating new Power Platform environments may inadvertently
          bypass DLP policy settings or misconfigure the security settings of their
          environment.

        rationale: All users in the tenant have access to the default Power Platform
          environment. Those users may inadvertently use connectors that share sensitive
          information with others who should not have access to it. Users requiring
          Power Apps should be directed to conduct development in other Power Platform
          environments with DLP connector policies customized to suit the user's needs
          while also maintaining the agency's security posture.

          Power Platform tenant isolation is different from Microsoft Entra ID wide
          tenant

          restriction. It does not impact Microsoft Entra-based access outside of
          Power

          Platform. Power Platform tenant isolation only works for connectors

          using Microsoft Entra-based authentication, such as Office 365 Outlook or

          SharePoint. The default configuration in Power Platform has tenant

          isolation set to **Off**, allowing for cross-tenant connections to

          be established. A user from tenant A using a Power App with a connector

          can seamlessly establish a connection to tenant B if using appropriate

          Microsoft Entra ID credentials.

          If admins want to allow only a select set of tenants to establish

          connections to or from their tenant, they can turn on tenant isolation.

          Once tenant isolation is turned on, inbound (connections to the tenant

          from external tenants) and outbound (connections from the tenant to

          external tenants) cross-tenant connections are blocked by Power Platform

          even if the user presents valid credentials to the Microsoft Entra-secured
          data

          source.'
        remediation: '1.  Repeat steps 1 to 11 in the MS.POWERPLATFORM.2.1v1 instructions.


          2.  At the **Scope** section for the default environment, select **Add multiple
          environments** and select the non-default environments where you wish to
          enforce a DLP policy upon. If you wish to apply the DLP policy for all environments
          including environments created in the future select **Add all environments**.


          4.  Select **Next**-\> **Create Policy** to finish.'
        rationale: Users may inadvertently use connectors that share sensitive information
          with others who should not have access to it. DLP policies provide a way
          for agencies to detect and prevent unauthorized disclosures.
