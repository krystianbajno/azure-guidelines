        description: 'External meeting participants SHOULD NOT be enabled to request

        remediation: "To help ensure external participants do not have the ability\
          \ to request\ncontrol of the shared desktop or window in the meeting:\n\n\
          1.  Sign in to the **Microsoft Teams admin center**.\n\n2.  Select **Meetings**\
          \ > **Meeting policies**.\n\n3.  Select the **Global (Org-wide default)**\
          \ policy.\n\n4.  Under the **Content sharing** section, set **External\n\
          \    participants can give or request control** to **Off**.\n\n5.  If custom\
          \ policies were created, repeat these steps for each\n    policy, selecting\
          \ the appropriate policy in step 3."
        rationale: An external participant with control of a shared screen could potentially
          perform unauthorized actions on the shared screen. This policy reduces that
          risk by removing an external participant's ability to request control. However,
          if an agency has a legitimate use case to grant this control, it may be
          done on a case-by-case basis.
        notes:
        - This policy applies to the Global (Org-wide default) meeting policy, as
          well as custom meeting policies.

        remediation: "To configure settings for anonymous users:\n\n1.\tSign in to\

          \ were created, repeat these steps for each policy, selecting the appropriate\
          \ policy in step 3."
        rationale: For agencies that implemented custom policies providing more flexibility
          to some users to automatically admit "everyone" to a meeting - this policy
          provides protection from anonymous users starting meeting to scrape internal
          contacts.

        rationale: Automatically allowing admittance to anonymous and dial-in users
          diminishes control of meeting participation and invites potential data breach.
          This policy reduces that risk by requiring all anonymous and dial-in users
          to wait in a lobby until admitted by an authorized meeting participant.
          If the agency has a use case to admit members of specific trusted organizations
          and/or B2B guests automatically, custom policies may be created and assigned
          to authorized meeting organizers.
        notes:
        - This policy applies to the Global (Org-wide default) meeting policy. Custom
          meeting policies MAY be created to allow specific users more flexibility.
          For example, B2B guest users and trusted partner members may be admitted
          automatically into meetings organized by authorized users.

        rationale: Requiring internal users to wait in the lobby for explicit admission

        rationale: Allowing any user to record a Teams meeting or group call may lead
          to unauthorized disclosure of shared information, including audio, video,
          and shared screens. By disabling the meeting recording setting in the Global
          (Org-wide default) meeting policy, an agency limits information exposure.

          This section helps reduce security risks related to external and unmanaged
          user access. In this instance, external users refer to members of a different
          M365 tenant, and unmanaged users refer to users who are not members of any
          M365 tenant or organization.

          External access allows external users to look up internal users by their

          email address to initiate chats and calls entirely within Teams.

          Blocking external access prevents external users from using Teams as an

          avenue for reconnaissance or phishing. Even with external access

          disabled, external users will still be able to join Teams calls,

          assuming anonymous join is enabled. Depending on agency need, if both

          external access and anonymous join are blocked—neither required

          nor recommended by this baseline—external collaborators would only be

          able to attend meetings if added as B2B guest users.

          External access may be granted on a per-domain basis. This may be

          desirable in some cases (e.g., for agency-to-agency collaboration). See

          the Chief Information Officer Council''s [Interagency Collaboration

          Program](https://community.max.gov/display/Egov/Interagency+Collaboration+Program)
          Office of Management and Budget MA site for a list of .gov domains for sharing.

          Similar to external users, blocking contact with unmanaged Teams users prevents
          these users from looking up internal users by their email address and initiating
          chats and calls within Teams. These users would still be able to join calls,
          assuming anonymous join is enabled. Additionally, unmanaged users may be
          added to Teams chats if the internal user initiates the contact.'
        remediation: "1.  Sign in to the **Microsoft Teams admin\n    center**.\n\n\
          2.  Select **Meetings** > **Live events policies**.\n\n3.  Select **Global\

          \ repeat these steps for each\n    policy, selecting the appropriate policy\
          \ in step 3."
        rationale: The security risk of the default settings for Live Events is Live
          Events can be recorded by all participants by default. Limiting recording
          permissions to only the organizer minimizes the security risk to the organizer's
          discretion for these Live Events.

        rationale: The default configuration allows members to communicate with all

          - N/A

          Data loss prevention (DLP) helps prevent both accidental leakage of

          sensitive information as well as intentional exfiltration of data. DLP

          forms an integral part of securing Microsoft Teams. There are

          several commercial DLP solutions available documenting support for

          M365. Microsoft itself offers DLP services, controlled within the Microsoft
          Purview

          compliance portal. Agencies may select any service that fits their needs
          and meets

          the requirements outlined in this baseline setting. The DLP solution selected
          by an agency

          should offer services comparable to those offered by Microsoft.

          Though using Microsoft''s DLP solution is not strictly

          required, guidance for configuring Microsoft''s DLP solution can be found
          in following section of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for
          Defender for Office 365.

          can limit its exposure to custom app vulnerabilities.

          Malware scanning protects M365 Teams assets from malicious software. Several

          scanning, see the following policies of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration

          - If using Microsoft Defender, require Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or
          2. These are included with

          E5 and G5 and are available as add-ons for E3 and G3.

          Several technologies exist for protecting users from malicious links

          included in emails. For example, Microsoft Defender accomplishes this by

          prepending

          `https://*.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=`

          to any URLs included in emails. By prepending the safe links URL,

          Microsoft can proxy the initial URL through their scanning service.

          Their proxy can perform the following actions:

          - Compare the URL with a block list.

          - Compare the URL with a list of know malicious sites.

          - If the URL points to a downloadable file, apply real-time file

          scanning.

          If all checks pass, the user is redirected to the original URL.

          Microsoft Defender includes link-scanning capabilities. Using Microsoft
          Defender is not strictly required for this purpose; any product fulfilling
          the requirements outlined in this baseline policy group may be used.

          If the agency uses Microsoft Defender to meet this baseline policy group,
          see the following policy of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline
          for Defender for Office 365 for additional guidance.

          - [MS.DEFENDER.1.3v1 \| CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender

          the standard or strict preset security policy.'
        remediation: Any product meeting the requirements outlined in this baseline
          policy may be used. If the agency uses Microsoft Defender, see the following
          implementation steps for [Safe Attachments](./defender.md#implementation-2)

        rationale: Users may click on malicious links in Teams, leading to compromise

          a response to a potential incident.
