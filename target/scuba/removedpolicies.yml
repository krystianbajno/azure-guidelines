        name: A list of approved IP addresses for sending mail SHALL be maintained
        severity: ''
        description: 'A list of approved IP addresses for sending mail SHALL be maintained.

          - _Removal date:_ May 2024

          - _Removal rationale:_ MS.EXO.2.1v1 is not a security configuration that
          can be audited and acts as a step in implementation of policy MS.EXO.2.2.
          Having the list of approved IPs will be added as a part of implementation
          of policy MS.EXO.2.2 and removed as a policy in the baseline.

        description: 'Users SHALL be prevented from running custom scripts on personal
          sites (aka OneDrive).

          - _Removal date:_ July 2024

          - _Removal rationale:_ The option to enable and disable custom scripting
          on personal sites (aka OneDrive) found in policy MS.SHAREPOINT.4.1v1 has
          been deprecated by Microsoft. All references including the policy and its
          implementation steps have been removed as the setting is no longer present.  Furthermore,
          it is no longer possible to allow custom scripts on personal sites.'

          created sites.

          - _Removal date:_ November 2024

          - _Removal rationale:_ Microsoft has noted that after November 2024 it will
          no longer be possible to prevent SharePoint in resetting custom script settings
          to its original value (disabled) for all sites. All references including
          the policy, implementation steps, and section, by direction of CISA and
          Microsoft, have been removed as the setting will be automatically reverted
          back to **Blocked** within 24 hours.

          **`TLP:CLEAR`**'
